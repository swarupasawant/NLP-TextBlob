# NLP-TextBlob

TextBlob is a Python library built on top of NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) that provides a simple API for common natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, and text classification.

TextBlob also includes some additional features not found in NLTK, such as a noun phrase extractor and a sentiment polarity analyzer. It also has a more user-friendly syntax that can simplify common NLP tasks. For example, instead of calling multiple methods in NLTK to tokenize, tag, and parse text, you can do it all with a single method in TextBlob.

Overall, TextBlob is a higher-level library that can be easier to use for beginners or for simple NLP tasks, while NLTK is a more comprehensive toolkit for more complex NLP tasks.
